Our team developed the EPAS Social Rewarding System to encourage more people to use EPAS. This allows you to count the number of people using EPAS by region and encourage users to use EPAS through friendly competition.

EPAS Social Rewarding System counts the records of notifications sent to surrounding vehicles when an emergency vehicle is operating in an emergency situation. This allows users to know that many people are using EPAS in their area or other areas, and encourages more people to use EPAS.

EPAS Social Rewarding System also uses Google Maps API, so it is developed with scalability to be used worldwide by adding map data.
